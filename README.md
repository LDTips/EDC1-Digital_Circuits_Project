# EDC1_Project
Microprogramming project and laboratories from Digital Circuits course

## Project

Design a digital circuit utilising integrated circuit logic in order to perform addition and then division of numbers.\
Then, design a sequencer for above-mentioned circuit.

Project was created and simulated in Xilinx ISE. Functional blocks like adders, condition blocks, registers, bit shifters were used

### Laboratory contents
Furthermore, following laboratories were completed:

0. Half-adder design
1. Karnaugh map combinatorial circuit design
2. Counter design using JK flip-flops
3. Sequential asynchronous detector of clock pulse edge
4. Basic digital circuit design based on two given subsytem designs, with the use of functional blocks

Labs 5,6 and 7 were related to the project
