# EDC1_Project
Microprogramming project and laboratories from Digital Circuits course

## Project

Design a digital circuit utilising integrated circuit logic in order to perform addition of numbers.
Project was created and simulated in Xilinx ISE. Functional blocks like adders, condition blocks, registers, bit shifters

### Laboratory contents
Furthermore, following laboratories were completed:
0. Half-adder design
1. Karnaugh map combinatorial circuit design
2. Counter design using JK flip-flops
3. Sequential asynchronous detector of clock pulse edge
Other labs were regarding above-mentioned project
